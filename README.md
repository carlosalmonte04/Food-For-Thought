Our app is going to allow people to offer food in exchange for tutoring services. Tutors will submit offers to students’ posts and students can accept their services based on the tutor’s ratings. It will allow students to receive the additional help they need while providing much needed food for starving Flatiron students and acting as a platform for students to connect with their peers.
